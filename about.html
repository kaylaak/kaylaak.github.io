                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <h3>Hey There!</h3>
                <h2>I'm Kayla Kraft, a recent graduate from Lehigh University with a degree in Computer Science and Business. During my time at Lehigh, I discovered I have a passion for working for clients and using different techonology to help create solutions for them.</h2>


                <h2>For the past two summers, I've had the opportunity to intern as a Software Engineer at Microsoft in Redmond, WA. During Summer 2022, I was placed on the Web XT Edge Performance. This is where I was able to work in C/C++ to improve the user's experience on the Edge browser. During Summer of 2023, I was on the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/machine-configuration/overview" target="_blank">Automanage Machine Configuration</a> team, where I created an Extension Repair Tool in C++ and Go to enhance the Azure Arc user experience. </h2>

                        
               <h2>As the head Teaching Assistant for Introduction to Programming over three semesters, I discovered my passion for helping others. After graduation, I launched my own tutoring services, offering personalized 1:1 and group lessons. Through this, I've helped students to grasp programming concepts and create a deeper understanding of the subject.

               </h2>
                 
               <h2>When I'm not coding, you'll often find me hanging out with my dog, Kookie, or going for long walks to get my daily steps in. 
               I'm also a huge foodie! I love exploring new restaurants and cuisines, and I LOVE sharing my culinary adventures on Yelp.</h2>
               
               <h2>Looking ahead, I'm excited about the possibilities in the tech industry. Currently, I am interested in becoming a Product Manager or a Tech Consultant, where I can continue to learn, grow, and work with different clients of all backgrounds.</h2>
