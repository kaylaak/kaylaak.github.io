                <h2> As a former head Teaching Assistant for Introduction to Programming (Java) over three semesters, I've had the chance to sharpen my teaching skills and help students understand complex concepts better. My time at the Coder School in Roslyn, NY, gave me hands-on experience tutoring children of various ages, from introducing programming basics to guiding them through more advanced projects.</h2>

                <h2> Working with a diverse range of students, including those with disabilities, homeschoolers, and passionate computer science enthusiasts, has deepened my technical abilities and fueled my passion for education and mentorship. These experiences have not only broadened my perspective but have also reinforced my commitment to empowering others through knowledge and guidance.</h2>

                <h2>I am proficient in teaching Scratch, HTML/CSS, and Java, and I can also assist students with AP Computer Science A and AP Computer Science Principles in preparation for their AP exams.</h2>
